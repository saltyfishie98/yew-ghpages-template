# yew-ghpages-template

A basic yew-rs project template for that deploys on github pages

### Note:
- When creating from this template "include all branch" needs to be enabled to include the "gh-pages" branch; where the webpage would be deployed. Else, a "gh-pages" branch needs to be created manually.

- Workflow actions needs to have read and write access for "gh-pages" to be deployed successfully



## Customization

- The project name can be changed by changing all instances of the word "yew-ghpages-template"
